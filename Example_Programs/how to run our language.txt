javac Translator.java Parser.java Tuple.java

Use the above javac command in a java compiler (such as lectura) and compile all three.
The translator, the parser, and tuple.

Then to run your file, use:
java Translator your_file.txt

So for example:
java Translator test.txt

Which is a file you can run to try. It runs a double loop.

You can have the program enter your own input by just writing "input" without the quotations.
Then, each number you type will correspond to a variable:
ia
ib
ic
id
...
So whatever number you type first will become the value of ia in your program, second number for ib, etc.
